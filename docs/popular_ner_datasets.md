# Named Entity Recognition (NER) Datasets

For `Named Entity Recognition (NER)` tasks, there are several well-known datasets 
across platforms like Hugging Face and Kaggle. 
These datasets are often used to train, fine-tune, and evaluate NER models, 
ranging from general-purpose to domain-specific applications.

### Hugging Face Datasets for NER:
1. **CoNLL-2003**
   - **Description**: A widely used dataset for NER in English. It contains four types of entities: persons, locations, organizations, and miscellaneous.

2. **OntoNotes 5.0**
   - **Description**: A large corpus that supports multiple NLP tasks, including NER. It includes seven types of named entities: people, organizations, geo-political entities, locations, time expressions, numeric expressions, and facilities.

3. **WNUT 17 (Workshop on Noisy User-generated Text)**
   - **Description**: Focuses on NER in noisy text (like social media or user-generated content), with a focus on emerging or rare entities.

4. **WikiAnn (Panx)**
   - **Description**: A multilingual NER dataset built from Wikipedia links. It covers 282 languages, with the same four entity types as CoNLL: person, organization, location, and miscellaneous.

### Kaggle Datasets for NER:
1. **Annotated Corpus for Named Entity Recognition**
   - **Description**: A general NER dataset with text labeled for person names, organizations, locations, and miscellaneous entities.

Each dataset caters to different applications, and the choice depends on the nature of the NER task (general, domain-specific, multilingual, noisy text, etc.).
