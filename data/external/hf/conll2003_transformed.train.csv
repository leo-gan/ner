9901,WASHINGTON 1996-08-28,,WASHINGTON,
9902,The Securities and Exchange Commission Wednesday approved rules designed to give stock market investors a better chance at getting the best price available for their orders .,,,Securities and Exchange Commission
9903,"The so-called order handling rules , which were proposed last September , were approved in a 4-0 vote .",,,
9904,The new rules will require specialists at stock exchanges and market makers on Nasdaq to allow customers to view price quotes from other electronic trading systems that may not be readily available to them .,,,
9905,The rules will also require that customer limit orders be displayed with prices better than those available in quotes publicly available at the time .,,,
9906,Specialists and market makers are companies or individuals recognised as qualified to maintain an orderly market in a stock .,,,
9907,"In a limit order , investors specify the price at which they are willing to buy or sell , as opposed to a market order executed at prevailing prices .",,,
9908,""" These rules are intended to empower all investors , by allowing their orders to compete on a level playing field , and by providing the disclosure they need to make informed decisions , "" said SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt .",Arthur Levitt,,SEC

9911,"In proposing the rules last year , the SEC noted that while technology has improved , commonplace practices still existed that worked against investors ' best interests .",,,SEC
9912,It noted that customers whose orders were not displayed lost the chance of getting the best possible price available in the market .,,,
9913,"It also cited the potential problem of a two-tiered market in which market makers quote one price to public investors while quoting better prices in private systems , thus robbing investors without access to "" hidden "" quotes the benefit of the best available prices .",,,
9914,"Earlier this month , the SEC settled charges of alleged malpractices on Nasdaq when the parent of the Nasdaq market , the National Association of Securities Dealers , agreed to spend $ 100 million over five years to upgrade its oversight of brokers ' trading practices .",,,SEC;National Association of Securities Dealers
9915,The SEC dropped a third proposal that would have allowed investors with market orders to trade at a better price if there were shifts in prices before their orders were executed .,,,SEC
9916,"The agency said it would monitor effects of the two new rules before considering the "" price improvement "" proposal again .",,,
9917,"The agency also proposed rule changes that would require continuous "" bid "" and "" ask "" quotations from exchange specialists and market makers who trade more than 1 percent of a stock during any quarter on Nasdaq .",,,

13912,The outcome of the November elections emerged as a hot topic on Wall Street this week as financial pundits debated whether Robert Rubin might forgo a second term as Treasury secretary if President Clinton is re-elected .,Robert Rubin;Clinton,Wall Street,Treasury
13913,Concern centred on the currency markets since Rubin 's tour de force has been his unflagging support of the dollar .,Rubin,,
13914,Speculation that Rubin might not stay in his post grew after he sidestepped questions about any future Cabinet post during television interviews at the Democratic convention in Chicago this week .,Rubin,Chicago,Cabinet
13915,"Should Rubin leave , Wall Street would worry that he might take his strong-dollar policy with him .",Rubin,Wall Street,
13916,"Rubin 's predecessor at the Treasury , Lloyd Bentsen , was viewed with suspicion by some in the financial markets who thought he had tried to push down the dollar to gain an edge in trade negotiations with Japan .",Rubin;Lloyd Bentsen,Japan,Treasury
13917,""" Obviously , under the Clinton administration , we 've seen two distinctively different dollar policies , "" said Chris Widness , an international economist at Chase Securities Inc.

13918,"That strategy , backed up by timely instances of joint central bank intervention , helped the dollar battle back from post-Second World War lows of 1.3438 German marks on March 8 , 1995 , and 79.75 Japanese yen on April 19 , 1995 .",,,
13919,"Currently , the dollar stands at about 1.48 marks and 109 yen .",,,

13925,Some overseas investors might shy away from buying U.S. stocks and bonds or even sell them when the dollar is weakening .,,U.S.,
13926,"As for U.S. Treasury securities , Widness explained that Alan Greenspan 's reappointment as chairman of the Federal Reserve and the outlook for the federal budget were more important than whether Rubin continues at the Treasury .",Widness;Alan Greenspan;Rubin,,U.S. Treasury;Federal Reserve;Treasury
